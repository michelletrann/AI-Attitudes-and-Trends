## Executive Summary

Rising ethical concerns in data governance and artificial intelligence (AI) may differ across populations with varying degrees of trust. Given the unprecedented capabilities of artificial intelligence, the role of public opinion may greatly shape AIâ€™s implementation to include future regulation and critical decision-making processes. Discerning these attitudes is valuable in capturing the current culture of technology development and understanding. 

Our team used a 2019 dataset assembled by Baobao Zhang and Allan Dafao that collected a series of survey responses to questionnaires regarding artificial intelligence, ranging from questions about its governance to its potential harms. We focus on visualizing survey responses depending on demographic factors such as race, gender, and education level.
